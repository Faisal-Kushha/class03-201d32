# Links:

## 1- Creating links between pages
## 2- Linking to other sites
## 3- Email links

Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow  us to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

 **Types of links:**
 
● Links from one website to another.

● Links from one page to another on the same website.

● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page.

● Links that open in a new browser window.

● Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone.

**Linking to Other Sites**

 If you want to mention one HTTP status code, then describing it in your document might make sense. If you want to make sure that your reader understands the idea of HTTP status codes, and knows what several of them mean, then linking them to an external document (such as the HTTP spec) might be a good idea.

**Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site**

## Relative URLs

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

|Relative Link Type|
|------------------|
|Same Folder :To link to a file in the same folder, just use the file name|
|Child Folder, use the name of the child folder,followed by a forward slash, then the file name.|
|Grandchild Folder Use the name file,then by aforward slash,then the name of grandchild folder followed by another forward slash,then the file name.|
|Parent Folder Use ../ to indicate the folder above the current one, then follow it with the file name.|
|GrandParent Folder Repeat the ../ to indicate that you want to go up two folders (rather than one), then follow it with the file name.|

**Summary of links**

1- Links are created using the <a> element.
  
2- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
  
3- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
  
4- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
  
5- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
  

 # Layout:
  
**Building Blocks**
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
  
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. 
  
You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too) To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors. 
  
  
**Containing Elements**
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
  
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation).
  
The <div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing elements.
  
**Floating Elements float**
  
  The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.
  
  Anything else that sits inside
the containing element will
flow around the element that is
floated.
